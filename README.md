## Installations:
  1. You will need to install Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.
  2. You will need to install the Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).

## Motivation:
   As an aspiring People Data Analyst, I decided to use IBM's HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance dataset to show the skills I learned from Udacity's Data Scientist Nonodegree Program. For this capstone, I will apply the data science process CRISP-DM that I have been familiar with.
  
## File:
  1. HR-Employee-Attrition.csv: This is the Dataset I used in my project .
  2. Capstone Project - DSND.ipynb: This is my notebook where I did my analysis and build my model.

## Results:
  Results and discussion are published on [Medium](https://abdulellah-hud.medium.com/ibm-hr-analytics-employee-attrition-9df152b91d3c). 
  
## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements:
